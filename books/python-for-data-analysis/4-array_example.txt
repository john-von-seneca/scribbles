2D ndarray A matrix of data, passing optional row and column labels
dict of arrays, lists, or tuples Each sequence becomes a column in the DataFrame. All sequences must be the same length.
NumPy structured/record array Treated as the ¡°dict of arrays¡± case
dict of Series Each value becomes a column. Indexes from each Series are unioned together to form the
result¡¯s row index if no explicit index is passed.
dict of dicts Each inner dict becomes a column. Keys are unioned to form the row index as in the ¡°dict of
Series¡± case.
list of dicts or Series Each item becomes a row in the DataFrame. Union of dict keys or Series indexes become the
DataFrame¡¯s column labels
List of lists or tuples Treated as the ¡°2D ndarray¡± case
Another DataFrame The DataFrame¡¯s indexes are used unless different ones are passed
NumPy MaskedArray Like the ¡°2D ndarray¡± case except masked values become NA/missing in the DataFrame result
