    "* In cases where one tail is long but the other tail is fat, skewness does not obey a simple rule.\n",
    "  * For example, a zero value indicates that the tails on both sides of the mean balance out, which is the case for a symmetric distribution, but is also true for an asymmetric distribution where the asymmetries even out, such as one tail being long but thin, and the other being short but fat.\n",
